# Using SASS

Rewrite some of the CSS for the course home page (supplied) as SASS.

## Description

Use the supplied CSS file as starting point, break the starting point down and move parts of it into modular SASS files - one for the side-head, one for the side-nav, one for the main-head, and one for the top-panel.
Compile SASS into a production-ready CSS file, and load that into the application.

## Built With

HTML CSS SASS JS
